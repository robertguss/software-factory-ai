defmodule Conveyor.Gate.IntegrityEvidence do
  @moduledoc """
  ADR-23 — produce the IntegritySentinel `integrity_verdict` for the loop.

  Thin, deterministic wrapper over `Conveyor.Verification.IntegritySentinel`: run
  the (anti-vacuity) probes over a slice run's observations and return the verdict
  string that `Conveyor.Gate.TrustEvidence` already reads from the run output.

  ## The safety property (why this is safe to wire incrementally)

  A probe with no observation evaluates to `not_assessed` (never `failed`), and the
  overall verdict is `not_assessed` unless some probe actually failed/was suspect.
  `TrustEvidence` maps `not_assessed` to a non-blocking integrity signal, so wiring
  the sentinel with *partial* observations can never force a spurious abstain — it
  only abstains on a genuine probe failure (e.g. production source mutated during
  the test run, a hidden network/secret dependency). As real observation producers
  come online per probe, the gate tightens automatically.

  ## Remaining work (the producers — a dedicated pass)

  `Conveyor.Stations.Verify` now wires this helper in the production loop
  (`verify.ex`), supplying the `hermeticity` + `source_mutation` observations. What
  is NOT yet wired is the *collection* of the remaining probe observations
  (mount-boundary from the diff, falsifier survival from the contract's seeds, etc.)
  and, since hermeticity is only asserted under a hermetic backend (docker),
  local-backend runs keep most probes `not_assessed`/non-blocking. Completing the
  full producer set is M4. Calling this helper with `%{}` is a safe no-op verdict.
